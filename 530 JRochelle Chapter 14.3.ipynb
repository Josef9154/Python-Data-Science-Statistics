    "**Exercise:** [In a recent paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7044435/), Stein et al. investigate the effects of an intervention intended to mitigate gender-stereotypical task allocation within student engineering teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before and after the intervention, students responded to a survey that asked them to rate their contribution to each aspect of class projects on a 7-point scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the intervention, male students reported higher scores for the programming aspect of the project than female students; on average men reported a score of 3.57 with standard error 0.28. Women reported 1.91, on average, with standard error 0.32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the sampling distribution of the gender gap (the difference in means), and test whether it is statistically significant. Because you are given standard errors for the estimated means, you donâ€™t need to know the sample size to figure out the sampling distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the intervention, the gender gap was smaller: the average score for men was 3.44 (SE 0.16); the average score for women was 3.18 (SE 0.16). Again, compute the sampling distribution of the gender gap and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, estimate the change in gender gap; what is the sampling distribution of this change, and is it statistically significant?"
